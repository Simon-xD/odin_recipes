This is the first real task in "The Odin Project".

I had to build a html recipe website with my new skills.

The skills to show off:

- Boilerplate setup
- Edit text (paragraphs, headings, bold, italic, comments...)
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Embed links and images

Feel free to give some feedback ;)
