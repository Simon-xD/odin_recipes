This is the first recipe lesson/task in "The Odin Project".

Now i have to show what I learned in form of an html recipe website.
The skills to show off:

- Boilerplate setup
- edit text (paragraphs, headings, bold, italic, comments...)
- ordered and unordered lists
- embed links and images

Feel free to give some feedback ;)
